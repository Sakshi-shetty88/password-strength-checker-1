**DURATION: NOVEMBER TO DECEMBER**

**Project Overview:**

The Password Strength Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on various criteria like length, complexity, and the inclusion of special characters, numbers, and upper/lowercase letters. The goal of this project is to help users assess whether their passwords are secure enough or if they need to be stronger. This tool can provide feedback on passwords, indicating whether they are Weak, Moderate, or Strong based on certain rules.

**Key Features of the Project:**

-Password Length Check:
                  Ensures that the password is long enough, usually a minimum of 8 characters.

-Complexity Check:

-Verifies if the password contains a mix of: 
Lowercase letters
Uppercase letters
Numbers
Special characters (like @, #, $, %, etc.)

-Strength Evaluation:

Based on the checks, the tool will classify the password as:

Weak: If the password is too short or lacks basic complexity.

Moderate: If the password has some complexity but is still not entirely secure.

Strong: If the password meets all the necessary criteria for security.

-User Feedback:
              The tool will give the user feedback such as "Password too short", "Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong" to guide them in creating a more secure password.

-Interactive Design:
                  The program can interact with the user via command line or a graphical user interface (GUI), depending on how you want to build it.

User Input:

Allow users to input a password.
Check if the input meets the required conditions.

Implementing Feedback Mechanism:

Based on the evaluation, give feedback to the user.

Provide a clear message explaining why the password is weak, moderate, or strong.
Testing the Program:

Test with different passwords to ensure the checker works properly.
Optimization (Optional):

Improve efficiency if needed and ensure the checker handles all edge cases (e.g., empty passwords, too long passwords, etc.).
Adding Features (Optional):

You can add extra features such as:

Password suggestions for improvement.

A scoring system that rates the strength based on different criteria.

-Technologies You Can Use:

Python: For writing the logic of the password checker. Use libraries such as re (regular expressions) to match specific patterns.

Tkinter (Optional): For building a GUI if you want the project to be more user-friendly.

Command-line Interface: To interact with the user and check passwords directly from the console.

**Sample Output**:
For inputting a password, the program will check if it satisfies the criteria and give output like:

Weak: "Password is too short, and missing uppercase and special characters."

Moderate: "Password is acceptable, but consider adding special characters."

Strong: "Password is strong and meets all criteria."
